The purpose of this project is for me to learn to build a C2 server and agents. Additionally, there are some other goals such as getting better at C programming (it has been a long time), use protocols for unintended purposes, writing Windows agents to evade detection, and joining in the fun of building C2 software.

This is simply a fun project for me to "waste" time on.
